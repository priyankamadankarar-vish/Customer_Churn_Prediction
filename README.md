# Customer_Churn_Prediction
🔮 Customer Churn Prediction with Machine Learning
Customer retention is one of the biggest challenges for businesses today. This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning so companies can take proactive actions to keep their customers.

🌟 Why This Project?
Acquiring new customers is 5x more expensive than retaining existing ones.
By predicting churn, companies can offer discounts, personalized offers, or better services to customers most likely to leave.
This project demonstrates how data-driven insights can directly support business strategy.
